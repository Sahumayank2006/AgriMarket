# Codestrix - Technical Implementation Guide

> A technical overview of the Codestrix project for the Smart India Hackathon 2024.

## 1. Technical Approach

Our technical strategy is built on a modern, robust, and secure foundation, leveraging industry-standard technologies to deliver a reliable and scalable solution.

### Algorithm Development
- **Core Technologies**: `Next.js` & `Express.js`
- **Description**: The primary business logic, including the proprietary OTH (One-Time Handshake) Algorithm, is developed using a combination of Next.js for the frontend framework and Express.js for the backend API layer. This combination allows for rapid development, server-side rendering for performance, and a powerful Node.js environment.

### Mobile Application Development
- **Framework**: `Flutter`
- **Description**: To ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience across all devices, we are using Flutter for mobile application development. This allows us to maintain a single codebase for both Android and iOS, guaranteeing cross-platform compatibility and faster deployment cycles.

### Encryption and Security
- **Algorithm**: Custom 8-layer Octa-512 bit encryption
- **Description**: Security is our top priority. We have implemented a custom, multi-layered encryption protocol to secure all data transmission and user authentication. This 8-layer, 512-bit encryption model ensures that data remains confidential and protected against unauthorized access.

### Cloud Services
- **Database**: `MySQL`
- **Description**: We use MySQL, a reliable and powerful relational database management system, to store and manage all application data.
- **API Layer**: `PHP`
- **Description**: The backend is powered by high-performance, responsive REST APIs built with PHP, providing a stable and efficient connection between the client applications and the central server.

## 2. Process Flow Architecture

Our system architecture is designed for security and efficiency, with distinct flows for web and mobile users.

### User Authentication Flow

1.  **Web Login**: The user initiates the login process from the web interface.
2.  **User Credentials**: The user submits their credentials (e.g., username and password).
3.  **USSD Handshake**: As a second factor of authentication, the system initiates a USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) handshake with the user's registered mobile device.
4.  **Login Success**: Upon successful verification of the USSD response, the user is granted access to the system.

### Mobile Interaction Flow

1.  **Dial USSD**: The user dials a specific USSD code on their mobile device to initiate an action.
2.  **Get Code**: The mobile device receives a unique code or menu.
3.  **API Communication**: The user's selection is sent to our central server via a secure API.
4.  **POST Request**: The API forwards the information to the central server as a POST request.
5.  **Status Response**: The server processes the request and sends a status response back to the user via the API, confirming the action.

## 3. Product Status

- **Current Progress**: We have successfully completed **80%** of the product build. Core features and architectural components are in place.
- **Next Steps**: The next phase of our development plan involves a comprehensive **Testing and Validation** process to ensure the application is bug-free, secure, and ready for a production environment.
